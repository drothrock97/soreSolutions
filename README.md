# soreSolutions
This repository was created for the Sore Solutions Pressure Sore Alert Device. RIT MSD P20018.

Some useful insights for when modifying the code:

Most, if not all changes will be made to the formMain.Designer.cs and formMain.cs files.
The formMain.Designer.cs file is used for adding/removing user inputs or timers and such that will be seen on the application screen.

The formMain.cs file is where all calculations and analyses occur.

Simulation profiles are found in the MattressDevice.cs file.

To see changes reflected in the application, you must first build the solution.
Afterwards, the application can be found in the SensingTexAPI>bin>Debug folder.
